# TUAA.py

This is the first script I created to move files downloaded by
TUAA's downloader application.

**USAGE**:

1. [Download](https://github.com/TheUnusAnnusArchive/TUAA-Downloader/releases/latest) The Unus Annus Downloader.
2. Download the files you need.
3. Edit variables of `TUAA.py` and run it.

**NOTE**: I do not recommend doing this because it's too hacky. Use the latest TUAA Downloader instead.
